The tensorflow-ocaml project provides some [OCaml](http://ocaml.org) bindings for [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org).

These bindings are in an early stage of their development. Some operators are not supported and the API is likely to change in the future. That being said they already contain the necessary to train a convolution network using various optimizers.

## Installation

The easiest way is probably to use opam.

```bash
opam install tensorflow
```

The opam package requires the TensorFlow library to be installed on your system.

* The version 0.0.6 of the opam package uses TensorFlow release 0.10: `libtensorflow-0.10.so`.
* The version 0.0.7 of the opam package uses release 0.11: `libtensorflow-0.11.so`.
* The current tip uses release 1.0: `libtensorflow.so.1.0`.

There are two ways to obtain these libraries:
* You can build them from source by following these steps:
    1. [Install the Bazel build system](http://bazel.io/docs/install.html)
    1. Clone the TensorFlow repo `git clone --recurse-submodules -b r1.0 https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow`
    1. In `tensorflow` run `./configure` then `bazel build -c opt tensorflow:libtensorflow_c.so`.
       - In order to build with GPU support, CUDA needs to be installed and specified during `./configure`.
* You can download prebuilt x86-64 linux binaries (CPU only), [libtensorflow-0.10.so](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/releases/download/0.0.5/libtensorflow-0.10.so), [libtensorflow-0.11.so](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/releases/download/0.0.6/libtensorflow-0.11.so) or [libtensorflow.so.1.0](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/releases/download/0.0.7/libtensorflow.so.1.0).

Adjust your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directory in which you've put `libtensorflow-0.1x.so` and finally download a [very simple example](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/tree/master/examples/basics/forty_two.ml) and compile it with the following command:
```bash
ocamlbuild forty_two.native -package ctypes -package ctypes.foreign -package core_kernel -package tensorflow -cflags -w,-40
```

Enjoy!

## Examples

Tensorflow-ocaml includes two different APIs to write graphs.

### Using the Graph API

The graph API is very close to the original TensorFlow API.
* Some MNIST based tutorials are available in the [examples directory](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/tree/master/examples/mnist).
* `examples/load/load.ml` contains a simple example where the TensorFlow graph is loaded from a file (this graph has been generated by `examples/load.py`).
* `examples/basics` contains some curve fitting examples. You will need gnuplot to be installed via opam to run the gnuplot versions.

### Using the FNN API

The FNN API is a layer based API to easily build neural-networks. A linear classifier could be defined and trained in a couple lines:

```ocaml
  let input, input_id = Fnn.input ~shape:(D1 image_dim) in
  let model =
    Fnn.dense label_count input
    |> Fnn.softmax
    |> Fnn.Model.create Float
  in
  Fnn.Model.fit model
    ~loss:(Fnn.Loss.cross_entropy `mean)
    ~optimizer:(Fnn.Optimizer.gradient_descent ~learning_rate:8.)
    ~epochs
    ~input_id
    ~xs:train_images
    ~ys:train_labels;
```
A complete VGG-19 model can be defined as follows:

```ocaml
let vgg19 () =
  let block iter ~block_idx ~out_channels x =
    List.init iter ~f:Fn.id
    |> List.fold ~init:x ~f:(fun acc idx ->
      Fnn.conv2d () acc
        ~name:(sprintf "conv%d_%d" block_idx (idx+1))
        ~w_init:(`normal 0.1) ~filter:(3, 3) ~strides:(1, 1) ~padding:`same ~out_channels
      |> Fnn.relu)
    |> Fnn.max_pool ~filter:(2, 2) ~strides:(2, 2) ~padding:`same
  in
  let input, input_id = Fnn.input ~shape:(D3 (img_size, img_size, 3)) in
  let model =
    Fnn.reshape input ~shape:(D3 (img_size, img_size, 3))
    |> block 2 ~block_idx:1 ~out_channels:64
    |> block 2 ~block_idx:2 ~out_channels:128
    |> block 4 ~block_idx:3 ~out_channels:256
    |> block 4 ~block_idx:4 ~out_channels:512
    |> block 4 ~block_idx:5 ~out_channels:512
    |> Fnn.flatten
    |> Fnn.dense ~name:"fc6" ~w_init:(`normal 0.1) 4096
    |> Fnn.relu
    |> Fnn.dense ~name:"fc7" ~w_init:(`normal 0.1) 4096
    |> Fnn.relu
    |> Fnn.dense ~name:"fc8" ~w_init:(`normal 0.1) 1000
    |> Fnn.softmax
    |> Fnn.Model.create Float
  in
  input_id, model
```
This model is used in the [following example](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/blob/master/examples/fnn/vgg19.ml) to classify any input image, in order to use it you will have to download some [pre-trained weights](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/releases/download/0.0.7/vgg19.cpkt).


There are also some MNIST based [examples](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/tree/master/examples/fnn).

### Character level RNN

A simplified version of [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) can also be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/blob/master/examples/char_rnn) which contains additional details.

## Dependencies

* [ocaml-ctypes](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes) is used for the C bindings.
* [Core_kernel](https://github.com/janestreet/core_kernel) is only necessary when generating the graph from OCaml, the wrapper itself does not need it.
* The code in the piqi directory comes from the [Piqi project](http://piqi.org). There is no need to install piqi though.
* [Cmdliner](https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner) is used for command line interfaces.
* [Gnuplot-ocaml](https://bitbucket.org/ogu/gnuplot-ocaml) is an optional dependency used by a couple examples.
