(* DepthToSpace for tensors of type T. *)

This is the reverse transformation of SpaceToDepth. More specifically,
this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the `depth`
dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the `height` and `width` dimensions.
The attr `block_size` indicates the input block size and how the data is moved.

  * Chunks of data of size `block_size * block_size` from depth are rearranged
    into non-overlapping blocks of size `block_size x block_size`
  * The width the output tensor is `input_depth * block_size`, whereas the
    height is `input_height * block_size`.
  * The depth of the input tensor must be divisible by
    `block_size * block_size`.

That is, assuming the input is in the shape:
`[batch, height, width, depth]`,
the shape of the output will be:
`[batch, height*block_size, width*block_size, depth/(block_size*block_size)]`

This operation requires that the input tensor be of rank 4, and that
`block_size` be >=1 and that `block_size * block_size` be a divisor of the
input depth.

This operation is useful for resizing the activations between convolutions
(but keeping all data), e.g. instead of pooling. It is also useful for training
purely convolutional models.

For example, given this input of shape `[1, 1, 1, 4]`, and a block size of 2:

```prettyprint
x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4]]]]

```

This operation will output a tensor of shape `[1, 2, 2, 1]`:

```prettyprint
   [[[[1], [2]],
     [[3], [4]]]]
```

Here, the input has a batch of 1 and each batch element has shape `[1, 1, 4]`,
the corresponding output will have 2x2 elements and will have a depth of
1 channel (1 = `4 / (block_size * block_size)`).
The output element shape is `[2, 2, 1]`.

For an input tensor with larger depth, here of shape `[1, 1, 1, 12]`, e.g.

```prettyprint
x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]]]

`[1, 2, 2, 3]`

```prettyprint

(* Deserialize and concatenate `SparseTensors` from a serialized minibatch. *)
(* The input `serialized_sparse` must be a string matrix of shape `[N x 3]` where
`N` is the minibatch size and the rows correspond to packed outputs of
`SerializeSparse`.  The ranks of the original `SparseTensor` objects
must all match.  When the final `SparseTensor` is created, it has rank one
higher than the ranks of the incoming `SparseTensor` objects
(they have been concatenated along a new row dimension).

The output `SparseTensor` object's shape values for all dimensions but the
first are the max across the input `SparseTensor` objects' shape values
for the corresponding dimensions.  Its first shape value is `N`, the minibatch
size.

The input `SparseTensor` objects' indices are assumed ordered in
standard lexicographic order.  If this is not the case, after this
step run `SparseReorder` to restore index ordering.

For example, if the serialized input is a `[2 x 3]` matrix representing two
original `SparseTensor` objects:

    index = [ 0]
            [10]
            [20]

and

    index = [ 2]
            [10]
    values = [4, 5]
    shape = [30]

then the final deserialized `SparseTensor` will be:

            [0 20]
            [1  2]

(* Computes the grayscale dilation of 4-D `input` and 3-D `filter` tensors. *)
(* The `input` tensor has shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, depth]` and the
`filter` tensor has shape `[filter_height, filter_width, depth]`, i.e., each
input channel is processed independently of the others with its own structuring
function. The `output` tensor has shape
`[batch, out_height, out_width, depth]`. The spatial dimensions of the output
tensor depend on the `padding` algorithm. We currently only support the default
'NHWC' `data_format`.

In detail, the grayscale morphological 2-D dilation is the max-sum correlation
(for consistency with `conv2d`, we use unmirrored filters):

    output[b, y, x, c] =
       max_{dy, dx} input[b,
                          strides[1] * y + rates[1] * dy,
                          strides[2] * x + rates[2] * dx,
                          c] +
                    filter[dy, dx, c]

Max-pooling is a special case when the filter has size equal to the pooling
kernel size and contains all zeros.

Note on duality: The dilation of `input` by the `filter` is equal to the
negation of the erosion of `-input` by the reflected `filter`. *)

(* Partitions `data` into `num_partitions` tensors using indices from `partitions`. *)
(* For each index tuple `js` of size `partitions.ndim`, the slice `data[js, ...]`

are placed in `outputs[i]` in lexicographic order of `js`, and the first
dimension of `outputs[i]` is the number of entries in `partitions` equal to `i`.
In detail,

    outputs[i].shape = [sum(partitions == i)] + data.shape[partitions.ndim:]

    outputs[i] = pack([data[js, ...] for js if partitions[js] == i])

`data.shape` must start with `partitions.shape`.

For example:

    # Scalar partitions
    partitions = 1
    num_partitions = 2
    data = [10, 20]
    outputs[0] = []  # Empty with shape [0, 2]

(* Interleave the values from the `data` tensors into a single tensor. *)
(* Builds a merged tensor such that

    merged[indices[m][i, ..., j], ...] = data[m][i, ..., j, ...]

    # Scalar indices
    merged[indices[m], ...] = data[m][...]

    # Vector indices
    merged[indices[m][i], ...] = data[m][i, ...]

Each `data[i].shape` must start with the corresponding `indices[i].shape`,
and the rest of `data[i].shape` must be constant w.r.t. `i`.  That is, we
must have `data[i].shape = indices[i].shape + constant`.  In terms of this
`constant`, the output shape is

    merged.shape = [max(indices)] + constant

Values are merged in order, so if an index appears in both `indices[m][i]` and
`indices[n][j]` for `(m,i) < (n,j)` the slice `data[n][j]` will appear in the
merged result.

For example:

    indices[0] = 6
    indices[1] = [4, 1]
    indices[2] = [[5, 2], [0, 3]]
    data[0] = [61, 62]

(* Inserts a dimension of 1 into a tensor's shape. *)
(* Given a tensor `input`, this operation inserts a dimension of 1 at the
dimension index `dim` of `input`'s shape. The dimension index `dim` starts at
zero; if you specify a negative number for `dim` it is counted backward from
the end.

This operation is useful if you want to add a batch dimension to a single
element. For example, if you have a single image of shape `[height, width,
channels]`, you can make it a batch of 1 image with `expand_dims(image, 0)`,
which will make the shape `[1, height, width, channels]`.

Other examples:

```prettyprint
# 't' is a tensor of shape [2]
shape(expand_dims(t, 0)) ==> [1, 2]
shape(expand_dims(t, 1)) ==> [2, 1]
shape(expand_dims(t, -1)) ==> [2, 1]

# 't2' is a tensor of shape [2, 3, 5]
shape(expand_dims(t2, 0)) ==> [1, 2, 3, 5]
shape(expand_dims(t2, 2)) ==> [2, 3, 1, 5]
shape(expand_dims(t2, 3)) ==> [2, 3, 5, 1]

(* A unigram sampler could use a fixed unigram distribution read from a
file or passed in as an in-memory array instead of building up the distribution
from data on the fly. There is also an option to skew the distribution by
applying a distortion power to the weights.

The vocabulary file should be in CSV-like format, with the last field
being the weight associated with the word.

For each batch, this op picks a single set of sampled candidate labels.

The advantages of sampling candidates per-batch are simplicity and the
possibility of efficient dense matrix multiplication. The disadvantage is that
the sampled candidates must be chosen independently of the context and of the
true labels. *)

(* Performs fractional max pooling on the input. *)
(* Fractional max pooling is slightly different than regular max pooling.  In
regular max pooling, you downsize an input set by taking the maximum value of
smaller N x N subsections of the set (often 2x2), and try to reduce the set by
a factor of N, where N is an integer.  Fractional max pooling, as you might
expect from the word 'fractional', means that the overall reduction ratio N
does not have to be an integer.

The sizes of the pooling regions are generated randomly but are fairly uniform.
For example, let's look at the height dimension, and the constraints on the
list of rows that will be pool boundaries.

First we define the following:

1.  input_row_length : the number of rows from the input set
2.  output_row_length : which will be smaller than the input
3.  alpha = input_row_length / output_row_length : our reduction ratio
4.  K = floor(alpha)
5.  row_pooling_sequence : this is the result list of pool boundary rows

Then, row_pooling_sequence should satisfy:

1.  a[0] = 0 : the first value of the sequence is 0
2.  a[end] = input_row_length : the last value of the sequence is the size
3.  K <= (a[i+1] - a[i]) <= K+1 : all intervals are K or K+1 size
4.  length(row_pooling_sequence) = output_row_length+1

elements in `input` must be complex numbers of the form \\(a + bj\\), where *a*
is the real part and *b* is the imaginary part returned by this operation.

(* Outputs a `Summary` protocol buffer with images. *)
(* The summary has up to `max_images` summary values containing images. The

height, width, channels]` and where `channels` can be:

*  1: `tensor` is interpreted as Grayscale.
*  3: `tensor` is interpreted as RGB.
*  4: `tensor` is interpreted as RGBA.

The images have the same number of channels as the input tensor. For float
input, the values are normalized one image at a time to fit in the range
`[0, 255]`.  `uint8` values are unchanged.  The op uses two different
normalization algorithms:

*  If the input values are all positive, they are rescaled so the largest one
   is 255.

*  If any input value is negative, the values are shifted so input value 0.0
   is at 127.  They are then rescaled so that either the smallest value is 0,
   or the largest one is 255.

The `tag` argument is a scalar `Tensor` of type `string`.  It is used to
build the `tag` of the summary values:

*  If `max_images` is 1, the summary value tag is '*tag*/image'.
*  If `max_images` is greater than 1, the summary value tags are
   generated sequentially as '*tag*/image/0', '*tag*/image/1', etc.

The `bad_color` argument is the color to use in the generated images for
non-finite input values.  It is a `unit8` 1-D tensor of length `channels`.
Each element must be in the range `[0, 255]` (It represents the value of a
pixel in the output image).  Non-finite values in the input tensor are
replaced by this tensor in the output image.  The default value is the color
red. *)

(* Copy a tensor setting everything outside a central band in each innermost matrix *)

Assume `input` has `k` dimensions `[I, J, K, ..., M, N]`, then the output is a
tensor with the same shape where

`band[i, j, k, ..., m, n] = in_band(m, n) * input[i, j, k, ..., m, n]`.

The indicator function 'in_band(m, n)` is one if
`(num_lower < 0 || (m-n) <= num_lower)) &&
(num_upper < 0 || (n-m) <= num_upper)`, and zero otherwise.

For example:

```prettyprint

                 [-1,  0,  1, 2]

                 [-3, -2, -1, 0]],

tf.matrix_band_part(input, 1, -1) ==> [[ 0,  1,  2, 3]
                                             [-1,  0,  1, 2]

(* Returns a batched diagonal tensor with a given batched diagonal values. *)

`output[i, j, k, ..., m, n] = 1{m=n} * diagonal[i, j, k, ..., n]`.

(* Pads a tensor with mirrored values. *)
(* This operation pads a `input` with mirrored values according to the `paddings`
you specify. `paddings` is an integer tensor with shape `[n, 2]`, where n is
the rank of `input`. For each dimension D of `input`, `paddings[D, 0]` indicates
how many values to add before the contents of `input` in that dimension, and
`paddings[D, 1]` indicates how many values to add after the contents of `input`
in that dimension. Both `paddings[D, 0]` and `paddings[D, 1]` must be no greater
than `input.dim_size(D)` (or `input.dim_size(D) - 1`) if `copy_border` is true
(if false, respectively).

The padded size of each dimension D of the output is:

`paddings(D, 0) + input.dim_size(D) + paddings(D, 1)`

(* Quantizes then dequantizes a tensor. *)
(* This op simulates the precision loss from the quantized forward pass by:
1. Quantizing the tensor to fixed point numbers, which should match the target
   quantization method when it is used in inference.
2. Dequantizing it back to floating point numbers for the following ops, most
   likely matmul.

There are different ways to quantize. This version does not use the full range
of the output type, choosing to elide the lowest possible value for symmetry
(e.g., output range is -127 to 127, not -128 to 127 for signed 8 bit
quantization), so that 0.0 maps to 0.

To perform this op, we first find the range of values in our tensor. The range
we use is always centered on 0, so we find m such that

1. m = max(abs(input_min), abs(input_max)) if range_given is true,
2. m = max(max(abs(min_elem(input)), abs(max_elem(input))) otherwise.

Our input tensor range is then [-m, m].

Next, we choose our fixed-point quantization buckets, [min_fixed, max_fixed].
If signed_input is true, this is

  [min_fixed, max_fixed ] =
      [-(1 << (num_bits - 1) - 1), (1 << (num_bits - 1)) - 1].

Otherwise, if signed_input is false, the fixed-point range is

  [min_fixed, max_fixed] = [0, (1 << num_bits) - 1].

From this we compute our scaling factor, s:

  s = (max_fixed - min_fixed) / (2 * m).

Now we can quantize and dequantize the elements of our tensor.  An element e
is transformed into e':

  e' = (e * s).round_to_nearest() / s.

Note that we have a different number of buckets in the signed vs. unsigned
cases.  For example, if num_bits == 8, we get 254 buckets in the signed case
vs. 255 in the unsigned case.

For example, suppose num_bits = 8 and m = 1.  Then

  [min_fixed, max_fixed] = [-127, 127], and
  s = (127 + 127) / 2 = 127.

Given the vector {-1, -0.5, 0, 0.3}, this is quantized to
{-127, -63, 0, 38}, and dequantized to {-1, -63.0/127, 0, 38.0/127}. *)

(* Reshapes a tensor. *)
(* Given `tensor`, this operation returns a tensor that has the same values
as `tensor` with shape `shape`.

If one component of `shape` is the special value -1, the size of that dimension
is computed so that the total size remains constant.  In particular, a `shape`
of `[-1]` flattens into 1-D.  At most one component of `shape` can be -1.

If `shape` is 1-D or higher, then the operation returns a tensor with shape
`shape` filled with the values of `tensor`. In this case, the number of elements
implied by `shape` must be the same as the number of elements in `tensor`.

For example:

```prettyprint
# tensor 't' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# tensor 't' has shape [9]

(* This op first slices `input` along the dimension `batch_dim`, and for each

(* Generate a single randomly distorted bounding box for an image. *)
(* Bounding box annotations are often supplied in addition to ground-truth labels
in image recognition or object localization tasks. A common technique for
training such a system is to randomly distort an image while preserving
its content, i.e. *data augmentation*. This Op outputs a randomly distorted
localization of an object, i.e. bounding box, given an `image_size`,
`bounding_boxes` and a series of constraints.

The output of this Op is a single bounding box that may be used to crop the
original image. The output is returned as 3 tensors: `begin`, `size` and
`bboxes`. The first 2 tensors can be fed directly into `tf.slice` to crop the
image. The latter may be supplied to `tf.image.draw_bounding_box` to visualize
what the bounding box looks like.

Bounding boxes are supplied and returned as `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]`. The
bounding box coordinates are floats in `[0.0, 1.0]` relative to the width and
height of the underlying image.

For example,

    # Generate a single distorted bounding box.
    begin, size, bbox_for_draw = tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box(
        tf.shape(image),
        bounding_boxes=bounding_boxes)

    # Draw the bounding box in an image summary.
    image_with_box = tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes(tf.expand_dims(image, 0),
                                                  bbox_for_draw)
    tf.image_summary('images_with_box', image_with_box)

    # Employ the bounding box to distort the image.
    distorted_image = tf.slice(image, begin, size)

Note that if no bounding box information is available, setting
`use_image_if_no_bounding_boxes = true` will assume there is a single implicit
bounding box covering the whole image. If `use_image_if_no_bounding_boxes` is
false and no bounding boxes are supplied, an error is raised. *)

(* Selects elements from `t` or `e`, depending on `condition`. *)
(* The `t`, and `e` tensors must all have the same shape,
and the output will also have that shape.  The `condition` tensor
must be a scalar if `t` and `e` are scalars.  If `t` and `e` are vectors
or higher rank, then `condition` must be either a vector with size
matching the first dimension of `t`, or must have the same shape as `t`.

The `condition` tensor acts as a mask that chooses, based on the value at each
element, whether the corresponding element / row in the output should be
taken from `t` (if true) or `e` (if false).

If `condition` is a vector and `t` and `e` are higher rank matrices, then
it chooses which row (outer dimension) to copy from `t` and `e`.
If `condition` has the same shape as `t` and `e`, then it chooses which
element to copy from `t` and `e`.

```prettyprint
# 'condition' tensor is [[True,  False]

# 't' is [[1, 2],

(* SpaceToBatch for N-D tensors of type T. *)
(* This operation divides 'spatial' dimensions `[1, ..., M]` of the input into a
grid of blocks of shape `block_shape`, and interleaves these blocks with the
'batch' dimension (0) such that in the output, the spatial dimensions
`[1, ..., M]` correspond to the position within the grid, and the batch
dimension combines both the position within a spatial block and the original
batch position.  Prior to division into blocks, the spatial dimensions of the
input are optionally zero padded according to `paddings`.  See below for a
precise description. *)

(* SpaceToDepth for tensors of type T. *)
(* Rearranges blocks of spatial data, into depth. More specifically,
this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the `height`
and `width` dimensions are moved to the `depth` dimension.
The attr `block_size` indicates the input block size and how the data is moved.

  * Non-overlapping blocks of size `block_size x block size` are rearranged
    into depth at each location.
  * The depth of the output tensor is `input_depth * block_size * block_size`.
  * The input tensor's height and width must be divisible by block_size.

That is, assuming the input is in the shape:
`[batch, height, width, depth]`,
the shape of the output will be:
`[batch, height/block_size, width/block_size, depth*block_size*block_size]`

This operation requires that the input tensor be of rank 4, and that
`block_size` be >=1 and a divisor of both the input `height` and `width`.

This operation is useful for resizing the activations between convolutions
(but keeping all data), e.g. instead of pooling. It is also useful for training
purely convolutional models.

For example, given this input of shape `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, and block_size of 2:

```prettyprint
x = [[[[1], [2]],
      [[3], [4]]]]
```

This operation will output a tensor of shape `[1, 1, 1, 4]`:

```prettyprint
[[[[1, 2, 3, 4]]]]
```

Here, the input has a batch of 1 and each batch element has shape `[2, 2, 1]`,
the corresponding output will have a single element (i.e. width and height are
both 1) and will have a depth of 4 channels (1 * block_size * block_size).
The output element shape is `[1, 1, 4]`.

For an input tensor with larger depth, here of shape `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, e.g.

```prettyprint
x = [[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
      [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]]
```

This operation, for block_size of 2, will return the following tensor of shape
`[1, 1, 1, 12]`

```prettyprint
[[[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]]]
```

Similarly, for the following input of shape `[1 4 4 1]`, and a block size of 2:

```prettyprint
x = [[[[1],   [2],  [5],  [6]],
      [[3],   [4],  [7],  [8]],
      [[9],  [10], [13],  [14]],
      [[11], [12], [15],  [16]]]]
```

the operator will return the following tensor of shape `[1 2 2 4]`:

```prettyprint
x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4],
       [5, 6, 7, 8]],
      [[9, 10, 11, 12],
       [13, 14, 15, 16]]]]
``` *)

`SparseReorder` to restore index ordering.

By default, if two values sum to zero at some index, the output `SparseTensor`
would still include that particular location in its index, storing a zero in the
corresponding value slot.  To override this, callers can specify `thresh`,
indicating that if the sum has a magnitude strictly smaller than `thresh`, its
corresponding value and index would then not be included.  In particular,
`thresh == 0` (default) means everything is kept and actual thresholding happens
only for a positive value.

(* Concatenates a list of `SparseTensor` along the specified dimension. *)
(* Concatenation is with respect to the dense versions of these sparse tensors.
It is assumed that each input is a `SparseTensor` whose elements are ordered
along increasing dimension number.

All inputs' shapes must match, except for the concat dimension.  The
`indices`, `values`, and `shapes` lists must have the same length.

The output shape is identical to the inputs', except along the concat
dimension, where it is the sum of the inputs' sizes along that dimension.

The output elements will be resorted to preserve the sort order along
increasing dimension number.

This op runs in `O(M log M)` time, where `M` is the total number of non-empty
values across all inputs. This is due to the need for an internal sort in
order to concatenate efficiently across an arbitrary dimension.

For example, if `concat_dim = 1` and the inputs are

    sp_inputs[0]: shape = [2, 3]
    [0, 2]: 'a'
    [1, 0]: 'b'
    [1, 1]: 'c'

    sp_inputs[1]: shape = [2, 4]
    [0, 1]: 'd'
    [0, 2]: 'e'

then the output will be

    shape = [2, 7]
    [0, 2]: 'a'
    [0, 4]: 'd'
    [0, 5]: 'e'
    [1, 0]: 'b'
    [1, 1]: 'c'

Graphically this is equivalent to doing

    [    a] concat [  d e  ] = [    a   d e  ]

zero elements do not participate*.  Specifically, the algorithm is equivalent
to the following:

      with shape `[B, C]`, along the size-C dimension;

(* Stops gradient computation. *)
(* When executed in a graph, this op outputs its input tensor as-is.

When building ops to compute gradients, this op prevents the contribution of
its inputs to be taken into account.  Normally, the gradient generator adds ops
to a graph to compute the derivatives of a specified 'loss' by recursively
finding out inputs that contributed to its computation.  If you insert this op
in the graph it inputs are masked from the gradient generator.  They are not
taken into account for computing gradients.

This is useful any time you want to compute a value with TensorFlow but need
to pretend that the value was a constant. Some examples include:

*  The *EM* algorithm where the *M-step* should not involve backpropagation
   through the output of the *E-step*.
*  Contrastive divergence training of Boltzmann machines where, when
   differentiating the energy function, the training must not backpropagate
   through the graph that generated the samples from the model.
*  Adversarial training, where no backprop should happen through the adversarial
   example generation process. *)

(* Creates a TensorArray for storing the gradients of values in the given handle. *)
(* If the given TensorArray gradient already exists, returns a reference to it.

Locks the size of the original TensorArray by disabling its dynamic size flag.

**A note about the input flow_in:**

The handle flow_in forces the execution of the gradient lookup to occur
only after certain other operations have occurred.  For example, when
the forward TensorArray is dynamically sized, writes to this TensorArray
may resize the object.  The gradient TensorArray is statically sized based
on the size of the forward TensorArray when this operation executes.
Furthermore, the size of the forward TensorArray is frozen by this call.
As a result, the flow is used to ensure that the call to generate the gradient
TensorArray only happens after all writes are executed.

In the case of dynamically sized TensorArrays, gradient computation should
only be performed on read operations that have themselves been chained via
flow to occur only after all writes have executed. That way the final size
of the forward TensorArray is known when this operation is called.

**A note about the source attribute:**

TensorArray gradient calls use an accumulator TensorArray object.  If
multiple gradients are calculated and run in the same session, the multiple
gradient nodes may accidentally flow throuth the same accumulator TensorArray.
This double counts and generally breaks the TensorArray gradient flow.

The solution is to identify which gradient call this particular
TensorArray gradient is being called in.  This is performed by identifying
a unique string (e.g. 'gradients', 'gradients_1', ...) from the input
gradient Tensor's name.  This string is used as a suffix when creating
the TensorArray gradient object here (the attribute `source`).

The attribute `source` is added as a suffix to the forward TensorArray's
name when performing the creation / lookup, so that each separate gradient
calculation gets its own TensorArray accumulator. *)
